# TODO: Add Authentication Test Cases to CI

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Add comprehensive test cases to authentication/tests.py for all auth endpoints (register, login, profile, update_profile, logout, protected views, admin view)
- [x] Ensure tests use APITestCase and cover success/failure scenarios
- [x] Run tests locally to verify they pass
- [x] Confirm CI pipeline runs the new tests (already configured)
